This repository contains a Flappy Bird game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game provides a classic and interactive gaming experience where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate through pipes without colliding with them or the ground.

## Features

- Control the bird by flapping its wings to avoid obstacles
- Randomly generated pipes with varying heights and gaps
- Collision detection with the ground and pipes
- Game over screen with an option to restart the game

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the Pygame library by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `python mpyFlappyBirdGame.py` to start the game.

## Controls

- Press the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards.

- If the bird collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and a game over screen is displayed.
